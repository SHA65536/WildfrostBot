This amount varies, but appears to be up to 10 Bling. Achieving combo kills is a second way to collect Bling. When the player kills more than a single enemy in a turn, each additional kill rewards 5 Bling multiplied by a rolling total of additional kills: the second kill will award 5 Bling, third would reward 10, fourth rewards 15 and so forth. The final way to earn Bling is by visiting Blingsnail Caves on the map. They will reward a random number of Bling that appears to be between 40 and 100 Bling."
