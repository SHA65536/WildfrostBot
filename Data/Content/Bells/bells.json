        "description": "Bells are effects that add extra rules to the game. Active bells appear in the top left corner, and hovering over them explains their effects. Bells can have positive and negative effects, sometimes both.\n\nSun Bells become active when you beat a Boss (not a Miniboss). After defeating a boss, you're presented with all Sun Bells not currently active, and get to choose one to activate for the rest of the run.\n\nChallenge Bells, once unlocked, can be selected while choosing your leader, and will affect your entire run. They have negative effects with tradeoffs. ||Having all three Challenge Bells active is required for Lumin Goop and Broken Vase to appear.||\n\n2-3 Modifier Bells are randomly selected every Daily Voyage. Most of them have negative or neutral effects, increasing the difficulty of Daily Voyages compared to normal runs.",
