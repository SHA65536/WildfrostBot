        "description": "**Pom** is a **Shade** that the player can summon by using the **Pom Mask**. A special trait of the Pom Mask is that it will summon Pom as an enemy and on the enemy side of the board in a location of choice. This means Pom's effect of \"adding barrage\" applies to the player, as the player is the enemy to Pom",
