        "description": "Snowdwell is the home to survivors in the era of the Wildfrost. Built around a large chunk of luminice, many gravitate to the settlement for protection. While Snowdwell starts as a small settlement, there are several structures that can be constructed which allow players to unlock more cards.\nSnowdwell offers many services as it expands, and each structure brings a new opportunity to unlock cards to use in a run. The challenges that must be completed may be viewed at their respective building, and almost all must be completed in a set order. This means the current challenge seen must be completed before the next one is revealed.",
